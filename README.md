# Introduction to JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms for dummies

JavaScript is a very powerful language. It is the most popular language in the world and is the most prominent language on the Internet :sunglasses:

[GitHub](https://github.com)(the world's largest code host), hosts over a million JavaScript repositories(the largest number of projects is in JavaScript; refer [here](https://octoverse.github.com/projects)). The number of projects in JavaScript in GitHub grows every year.

JavaScript is not a language that can be used on the front-end only. It can also be used in the back-end, and Node.js is the technology responsible for this. The number of [**Node Package Module(NPM)**](https://www.npmjs.com) also grows exponentially.
JavaScript is a must-have on your resume if you are or will become a web developer.

We will learn about the most used data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. JavaScript is very popular and is appropriate to learn about data structures because it is a functional language. Also, there is no other fun way of learning something new as it is very different and easier than learning about data structures with a standard language such as **C** or **Java**.

Learning about data structures and algorithms is very important. The first reason is that data structures and algorithms can solve the most common problem efficiently. This will make a difference to the quality of the source code you write in the future. If you choose the correct data structure or algorithm for your program, depending on your scenario, you may have some performance issues.

Data structures and algorithms are the subject of interviews during your job search in the future.

During our learning and coding time, we will be writing test cases for our data structures and algorithms just to make sure they work as we suppose and also we will be implementing or running our data structures and algorithms by writing simple test cases. This will also be a minimal introduction to testing in JavaScript.

We are going to cover the following:

- Data Structure
  - Sequential data structures
    - *Arrays*
    - *Stack*
    - *Queue*
    - *Dictionary*
    - *Set*
    - *Hash*
    - *Linked Lists*
  - Non-sequential data structure
    - *Graphs*
    - *Binary Trees*
- Sorting algorithms
  - *Bubble sort*
  - *Selection sort*
  - *Insertion sort*
  - *Merge sort*
  - *Quick sort*
  - *Heap sort*
- Searching algorithms
  - *Sequential search*
  - *Binary search*
